This is a fork of solomon23's fork of [sfsam/itsycal](https://github.com/sfsam/Itsycal), a very cool open source
status bar calendar.

Solomon23's fork alters the look of the calendar.

This fork slightly modifies that alternate look:

- title with greater padding, slightly altered alignment of top right buttons
- indentation of date columns in agenda view
- 3D-effect removed from pin icon, active pin icon is highlighted in blue
